# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

{$CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS} {
	# Set to run as reverse proxy:
	reverse_proxy localhost:9090
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
